# Rock-Paper-Scissors with score

Using code from here: https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/rock-paper-scissors-in-python

A fork from here: https://github.com/Aprataksh/Rock-Paper-Scissors

I've added a simple scoring system, first to 5 wins.

To use this, simply copy-paste it into a py file or download the py file by itself.
